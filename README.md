Data-Driven Machine-Learning Methods for Predicting Risk of Diabetes in youth. 

## BACKGROUND: 
In 2021, approximately 11.6% of the U.S. population had diabetes, with a significant portion undiagnosed. 39 million americans were reported to have diabetes in 2021.

Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to impaired insulin secretion or insulin action. This leads to serious health complications, including cardiovascular diseases, neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy.. Early detection and management are crucial to mitigate these risks and improve quality of life

HOWEVER, early detection is difficult and, unfortunately, infrequent relative to the population size having diabetes. Undiagnosed diabetes increases the risk of severe complications. According to the world health organization, increased severity of complications will often lead to a considerably decreased quality of life, increased mortality rate, and significant healthcare costs.


## PROBLEM SIGNIFICANCE: 
The asymptomatic Nature of Type 2 diabetes is problematic. Oftentimes, the onset is gradual, with many individuals experiencing no noticeable symptoms until significant damage has occurred. … The general lack of awareness about diabetes risk factors and the importance of early screening, particularly in high-risk populations, adds to the challenge of early detection. And, The issue of accessibility surrounding current screening methods, often costly, time-consuming, and inaccessible to certain populations, particularly those in low-income or rural areas, only perpetuates this dilemma.

Moreover, Diabetes is prevalent and dangerous with early detection proving difficult. 


## NEEDS STATEMENT:
As such, there is a critical need for accessible tools that have the potential to increase rates of early diagnosis.


## SOLUTION: 
In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO), apart from prevention, early diagnosis is one of the most effective ways to minimize the burden caused by diabetes. Thus, a solution might revolve around early detection made easier by Behavioral & Health Risk Factor Prediction Models.

This innovative tool leverages data-driven machine learning methods to provide an accessible, low-cost, and user-friendly solution for early diabetes risk assessment.


## OUR SOLUTION: GLUCOGATE
GLUCOGATE is the risk assessment tool built by Data-Driven Machine-Learning Methods for Predicting Risk of Diabetes in youth and adults

The model will train an algorithm to recognize disease symptoms and predict if a patient is at risk of/predisposed to Type 2 Diabetes. Model serves as an early self-assessment, intended to encourage proactive care. Model does NOT supersede medical consultation BUT, does serve as a preemptive step/preventative care with low barrier to entry (i.e. at no/low cost and improved accessibility).


## OUR SOLUTION: DESIGN
GLUCOGATE IS a new diabetic classification model that incorporates hyperparameter tuning and the addition of some interaction terms into the model. This tool is designed for youth and adults inquiring about their risk of diabetes early on.

The tool is designed to enhance health literacy with its  provision of information regarding diabetes, risk factors, and liftestyle modifications. The tool is designed with low-barrier to entry in mind, offering all individuals having access to the internet a low-cost or free option to evaluate risk. The tool’s inclusive design also caters to people with disabilities or limited digital literacy with it’s oversimplification of complex concepts or discussion. That being said, this tool is designed for individuals seeking health literacy, not medical consultation. Users should seek additional medical consultation from health care providers if they determine further steps should be taken.


## DATA:
Our prediction dataset will be a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (0,1). This data will include features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.
DATA SOURCES BEING CONSIDERED:
